- Images
    - White background
    - Exactly one pixel is black
    - For the given video, black pixel is linearly moving along one of the axis
    - 100x100
    - That is 10k pixels
    - For the given black pixel position we need at least two 'free' pixels at a single direction to move the black pixel
    - This sequence creates a single video
    - That is 100*100*4 = 40k frames
    //- That is: 2*(m*(n-2)) + 2*((m-3)*n) = 38800 frames
    
- Videos
    - Videos are made as a sequence of images using ffmpeg
        - A single image with a given black pixel position is a single frame
    - NN gets a video as an input and processes every two frames, generating the third frame
    - Training: 60%
        - 24k frames
    - Cross validation: 20%
        - 8k frames
    - Testing: 20%
        - 8k frames

TODO: Pri generovani to zrychlit a rovnou vygenerovany obrazek dat do VideoWriter 
      misto ulozeni na disku a pak nacteni z disku a az pak do VideWriter
