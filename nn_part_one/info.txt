- Using OpenCV to generate images
- Using with Python3
    - pip3 install opencv-python

- Images
    - White background
    - Exactly one pixel is black
    - For the given video, black pixel is linearly moving along one of the axis
    - For the given black pixel position we need at least two 'free' pixels at a single direction to move the black pixel
    - This sequence creates a single video

    
- Videos
    - Videos are made as a sequence of images using ffmpeg
        - A single image with a given black pixel position is a single frame
    - NN gets a video as an input and processes every two frames, generating the third frame
